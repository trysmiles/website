# **Rose (Rosy) Cersonsky**

<!-- Choose your title -- feel free to be professionally silly -->
**Role in the Cersonsky Lab**: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Knope">Leslie Knope</a>

<!-- Name at least one research topic amongst this list -->
**Things I'm excited about right now**: Getting the research of the Cersonsky lab up and running! 

<!-- Ultimately, we'll use this section to
     include papers and talks, and contributions
     But for now put whatever you want -->
**Cool stuff I've done**:
Professionally? I've <a href="github.com/rosecers">written some good code</a>, published <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B2cyV70AAAAJ&hl=en">some cool papers</a>, given lots of talks, and <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/2021colloids/victor-k-lamer-award/">won a few awards</a>. 

Outside of the lab, I love to run, climb, bake, and be in the outdoors!
