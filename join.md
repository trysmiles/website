**The Cersonsky Lab is actively recruiting post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate researchers to join our team!**

We look for candidates that are enthusiastic, motivated, creative and independent, with an attitude for critical thinking.
We are open to consider diverse scientific backgrounds at the doctoral level, while hiring at the post-doctoral level tends to be more focused.

Please consider that in order to perform a preliminary screening, all the inquiries that do not follow these guidelines might be silently ignored.
